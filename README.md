# I was having problems synchronizing my "nodejs" folder so I copy/pasted my public folder into the main "cs5610fall2015" directory and pushed it
# I think I "git init"-ed the sub folders in the past and that was causing my problems

# 11/22: My working directory is cs5610fall2015/nodejs/public and when I want to upload my work I copy that directory over to cs5610fall2015/public.
# This is awkward but it was the only fix I could find
